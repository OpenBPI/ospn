## Concept  
&emsp;&emsp;The concept of open social public network is to break social monopoly barriers, help enterprises to retain users, and help users to protect privacy. Based on the principle of "open" and "public", OSPN adopts a completely decentralized design, positioning itself as a "public network", which can be freely accessed and used by every enterprise.  

&emsp;&emsp;We thinkthat social monopoly poses a potential threat to society, enterprises and users. So we want users to be able to spread out, use products from multiple companies, and stay connected.  

&emsp;&emsp;For enterprises, users of a product are lost, on one hand, because the novelty of the product has passed, and on the other hand, because the product has not established enough user dependence. Social networking is the most effective way for products to build user dependency, because new generations occur every year, so it's never too late to enter the social arena.  

&emsp;&emsp;For users, privacy protection is very important, and enterprises will certainly find ways to collect users' privacy and use it for data analysis. How can an enterprise that will collect your privacy and use it wholeheartedly help users protect their privacy? This is clearly a paradox. Therefore, we put forward the concepts of "macro privacy protection", "micro privacy protection" and "anti-big data".  

### Macro privacy protection
&emsp;&emsp;Social monopoly means that all our privacy is concentrated in one enterprise. Including our personal information and our network of friends, this is a bad state for you and your friends. The concept of macro privacy protection is that you and your friends use the products of multiple enterprises, so your privacy information will be scattered to multiple enterprises, and the enterprises can only get a part of your network data, the accuracy of big data analysis will be reduced. And if you're a very privacy-conscious person, choosing a business that charges a fee is more conducive to protecting your privacy.

### Micro privacy protection  
&emsp;&emsp;The private nature of human conversation is that I tell you a sentence, and when you tell the third person "I said it," the third person can't tell if the sentence is mine.  
&emsp;&emsp;Our proposition is to do the same with private chats on the Internet, private chats except for the two of you, because there is no guarantee that the transcript will not be transmitted (it could be you, it could be him, even the language chat cannot be guaranteed), but we hope that the transcript will not be used as evidence. This is in keeping with the nature of private conversation.  
&emsp;&emsp;However, current chat software cannot do this, such as WeChat chat records can be used as evidence. Burning after reading isn't the best design either, because you have to drag your friend to the same app, and if he doesn't agree to use it, you can't.Our micro privacy protection can do this, please see our updated solution later.

### anti-big data  
&emsp;&emsp;Why are we anti-big data?We don't want to see companies analyzing our data. We cannot oppose the analysis of data by enterprises. We can only increase the difficulty of big data analysis by means of data diversification.
