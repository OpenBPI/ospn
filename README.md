## Concept  
&emsp;&emsp;The concept of open social public network is to break social monopoly barriers, help enterprises to retain users, and help users to protect privacy. Based on the principle of "open" and "public", OSPN adopts a completely decentralized design, positioning itself as a "public network", which can be freely accessed and used by every enterprise.  

&emsp;&emsp;We thinkthat social monopoly poses a potential threat to society, enterprises and users. So we want users to be able to spread out, use products from multiple companies, and stay connected.  

&emsp;&emsp;For enterprises, users of a product are lost, on one hand, because the novelty of the product has passed, and on the other hand, because the product has not established enough user dependence. Social networking is the most effective way for products to build user dependency, because new generations occur every year, so it's never too late to enter the social arena.  

&emsp;&emsp;For users, privacy protection is very important, and enterprises will certainly find ways to collect users' privacy and use it for data analysis. How can an enterprise that will collect your privacy and use it wholeheartedly help users protect their privacy? This is clearly a paradox. Therefore, we put forward the concepts of "macro privacy protection", "micro privacy protection" and "anti-big data".
